1) The purpose of the site is to explore using RxDB and RxJS together to
  access The New York Times api.

2) This site was created using VueJS 2.0, Webpack 2.0, Vue-Material, and Axios for http access.

3) During development I discovered that the NYT api is configured incorrectly for CORS.  According to the CORS spec, https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#preflight-request the preflight request should NOT include credentials.  The NYT api requires credentials for the OPTION preflight request.  The upshot is that you have to include the 'api-key' in the query string and not in the header for a browser based request.

Other changes to the API that would be nice include:
 * larger download sizes (20 is hard coded)
 * meta data access (you have to hunt to find out what the query options are)
 * faster access (rated limited to 5/second)

4) Instructions for building the site are included in the README.md file.  You can also go to https://johnwebbcole.github.io/nyt-explorer/ which provides the SPA as a static file.
